 Ticket Types 
 
 
 Your first and foremost responsibility as a mod is to efficiently manage the ticket system in Void Esports. We operate with two primary ticket categories, each requiring specific handling protocols. 
 
 
 
 
 General Ticket 
 These are created by community members for support inquiries, moderator assistance, or reporting issues. Handle with professionalism and follow escalation procedures for complex matters. 
 
 
 Roster Ticket 
 Application channel for users seeking to join Void Esports. Initial response must include age verification and direction to appropriate resources. Follow structured onboarding workflow. 
 
 
 
 
 Protocol: All ticket responses should begin with professional greeting and age inquiry. Direct new applicants to the appropriate channels and maintain detailed records of all interactions.

 Mod Responsibilities & Commands 
 
 
 Warn / Report Command 
 
 Use *warn user-id reason command exclusively in the #staff-commands channel for minor rule violations. For major or repeated infractions, utilize the /report command with detailed documentation. 
 
 
 
 
 LOA (Leave On Application) 
 
 When unavailable due to illness or personal circumstances, use the /loa command with clear duration and reason. Prior notification to senior staff is mandatory for extended absences. 
 
 
 
 
 Shift Management 
 
 Begin each moderation session with /login command and conclude with /logout command. Failure to log hours will result in activity discrepancies and potential disciplinary action. 
 
 
 
 
 Weekly Performance Metrics 
 
 Maintain minimum weekly thresholds to retain moderator status: 
 
 10 Tickets - Process support tickets 
 400 Messages - Active community engagement 
 5 Dyno Modlogs - Documented moderator actions 
 
 Performance below these standards triggers review and possible demotion. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ticket Handling Guidelines 
 
 
 Here is how you should proceed in tickets: 
 Remember to be professional at all times. Refrain from using informal responses like "Yo", "Hi", "Bro". Always start with a friendly greeting. 
 
 
 
 General Guidelines 
 
 
 
 Professional Greetings 
 
 
 Start every interaction with a professional greeting: 
 
 Hello, how may I help you? 
 Hello, what can I assist you with today? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Role Inquiry 
 
 
 Ask what role they are applying for: 
 
 What role are you applying for today? 
 What are you applying for here? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Age Verification 
 
 
 Always ask for age verification: 
 
 May I ask how old you are? 
 What is your current age?
